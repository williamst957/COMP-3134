Issues:
Without sanitizing the contents of the text file, the script in the file gets executed instead
of being displayed as text. 
In this case, the script redirects the browser to 'directory_traversal_part1.php' which lists
all files found within that file's directory. 
The user can see all files within the html folder and can even traverse up the directory.
