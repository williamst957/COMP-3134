When using the form in csfr_form.php:
- the session variable is passed to csfr_action.php which, based on the validation in that file, 
logs in the user and displays the success login message
- if the session variable that was passed did not match the variable that was passed in the
hidden field, the user would not be logged in 

When using the form in csfr.html: 
- this form does not have a hidden field containing a session variable; a session 
variable is not passed to csfr_action.php thus the user is not logged in
- no login message was displayed
